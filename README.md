Conclusion:
Based on above points, here are some suggestion for marketing strategy:

Individual Goal Tracking: Allow users to set individual goals for daily steps, calories burned or sleep duration.
The app can track progress against these goals and provide personalized incentives and reminders to help them achieve them.

Sharing Achievements on Social Media: Integrate the app with social media platforms such as Facebook or Instagram so that users can share their physical activity and sleep achievements.

Nutrition and Wellness Tips: In addition to providing information about physical activity and sleep, offer users tips and guidance on healthy nutrition, stress management strategies, and other wellness practices.
This will help users adopt a holistic lifestyle and improve their overall health.

Application Customization: Allow users to customize the application as per their preferences and needs. 
They can choose from different themes, receive personalized reminders or even adapt notification settings based on their individual preferences.
